# Activist

In the second quarter of Turing, we learn Rails fundamentals and are asked to do a project of our choice involving databases, CRUD, authentication/authorization, and ActiveRecord.  

The idea for Activist was spawned out of the frustration of wanting to attending events hosted by groups aligned with my interests. The activist e-landscape is scattered over various social media websites (Facebook, Meetup) and requires a signficant time and energy investment to create a calendar of events from disparate groups.

I chose to create an app where users can view political/activism events going on in their area, RSVP to them after creating a user account, view a dashboard of events and groups that they belong to as well as a listing of those by topic, and create events and groups.

This was an idea I had before I came to Turing, and it will continue to be a side project for me. The ultimate goal is to deploy this app to live production, including mobile options, with features such as finding events by zipcode or city, a Google map of events, a calendar of events, and allowing users to RSVP anonymously to help prevent government surveillance of activists.
